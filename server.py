Key drivers include recovering consumer spending, government infrastructure investment, and growth in the MSME and housing sectors. However, global economic slowdown, trade protectionism, and uneven private capex pose challenges. Inflation is expected to moderate, and the RBI may begin cutting rates. The external sector faces pressures from potential trade restrictions and fluctuations in capital flows.",
                "Key macroeconomic forecasts include: Real GDP growth of 6.4% in FY25 and 6.7% in FY26; CPI inflation averaging 5.0% in FY25 and 4.3% in FY26; and USD/INR exchange rate in the range of 85-86 by end of FY25 and 86-87 by end of FY26. Private consumption is shifting towards rural demand, supported by income support schemes and increased women's labor force participation. Investment growth is driven by government capex, but private capex remains uneven. The current account deficit is projected to be 1.5% of GDP in FY25 and 1.0% in FY26."

Consumer spending is expected to recover, primarily through a push from higher rural demand while urban demand continues to 'mean-revert'. A moderation in inflation is expected to help support discretionary demand both in rural and urban areas. Moreover, hiring intentions have started improving in the formal job market. This combined with government infrastructure spending, growth in the MSME segment and a continued upturn in the housing market is likely to support employment elsewhere. Lastly, a rise in women labour force participation in rural areas, improvement in standard of living at the bottom of the pyramid and cash transfers under various schemes by the government is likely to help repair household balance sheets and spur demand on a more sustained basis.",

Private consumption growth is expected to be 7.1% in FY25 and 7.5% in FY26. Investment growth is forecasted at 7.0% for FY25 and 7.2% for FY26. Exports (goods and services) growth is projected to be 7.5% in FY25 and 9.5% in FY26. Manufacturing growth is expected to be 2.6% in FY25 and 7.7% in FY26. Services growth is projected at 8.3% in FY25 and 5.6% in FY26. Nominal GDP growth is expected to be 10.1% in FY25 and 10.9% in FY26. CPI inflation is projected to average 5.0% in FY25 and 4.3% in FY26. Core inflation is expected to average 3.6% in FY25 and 4.5% in FY26. The current account deficit is projected to be 1.5% of GDP in FY25 and 1.0% of GDP in FY26. The fiscal deficit is projected to be 4.9% of GDP in FY25 and 4.5% in FY26. The RBI's repo rate is expected to be 6.5% in FY25 and 5.8% in FY26. The USD/INR exchange rate is projected to be in the range of 85-86 by the end of FY25 and 86-87 by the end of FY26.",

This assumes average crude oil price at USD 70-75 pbl. and gold prices to average at USD 2800 oz. in FY26. Narrowing of current account deficit in FY26 is likely to be led by higher services exports (net) and remittances, and a slowdown in crude oil imports as oil prices trend lower on excess global supply. However, export growth is anticipated to remain subdued due to a slowdown in Indiaâ€™s key trading partners and the influence of rising trade protectionist policies ('The Trump effect')."
